# jobchange_dashboard
Creating a dashboard hosted locally using a dataset on job changes for data scientists

The dataset I used was can be found on kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/hr-analytics-job-change-of-data-scientists). This project primarily uses dash to create a dashboard. The packages used can be found in the requirements.txt file. I've also added the dataset files in case the ones on kaggle have been updated/removed. I will be retricting myself to the aug_train.csv and sample_submission.csv file as I am only displaying data, no actual data analysis will take place in this project (so I won't need the aug_test dataset).
